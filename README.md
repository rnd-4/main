1. To install the project, clone the repo from main (the current and working version is there)
2. Locally next to the repo, create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Start the environment: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`, and install dependencies: `pip install -r .\requirments.txt`
4. Start the test server with the command: `python .\manage.py runserver`

If, God forbid, someone push something in main without a request, the face will be stuffed
